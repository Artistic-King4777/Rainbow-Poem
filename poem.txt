JoJo's Rainbow Flag And Unicorn Blood and its Pony


Pink
White
Purple
Black
Blue

Red and Black are Dark and cool, but
Orange and Green are Lovely to!

They drip so pretty from their flesh 
My Unicorns Blood is just the best!!

The pony comes to watch it spill
and make sure those in need can drink their fill
It protects the Unicorn from unsavory folks
And makes sure they aren't playing jokes

These are the colors of my rainbow!
